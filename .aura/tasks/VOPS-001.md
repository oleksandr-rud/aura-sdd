**Story ID**: VOPS-001

## Product Brief
### Problem
Users with mobility impairments and accessibility needs require hands-free PC control capabilities. Current solutions are either too expensive, require cloud connectivity (privacy concerns), or lack comprehensive automation features for professional workflows.

### Goals
- Enable voice-controlled PC automation for accessibility users
- Provide comprehensive RPA capabilities through natural language
- Ensure privacy through local-only processing
- Support cross-platform compatibility (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Deliver professional-grade automation accuracy (>95%)

### Success Metrics
- **Metric**: User task completion rate - **Target**: 90%+ - **Measurement**: User testing sessions
- **Metric**: Voice recognition accuracy - **Target**: 95%+ - **Measurement**: Automated accuracy testing
- **Metric**: End-to-end latency - **Target**: <1s - **Measurement**: Performance benchmarking
- **Metric**: Privacy compliance - **Target**: 100% local processing - **Measurement**: Security audit

### Constraints
- Must operate without internet connectivity
- Must support Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms
- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- Must provide rollback capabilities for all actions
- Must maintain <5% false positive rate for wake-word detection

### Attached Context
- **Market Research**: Market analysis to be conducted using research skill
- **User Interviews**: User research to be conducted using research skill
- **Technical Feasibility**: Technical analysis to be conducted using research skill
