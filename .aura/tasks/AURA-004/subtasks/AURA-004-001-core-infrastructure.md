# AURA-004-001: Core Infrastructure Setup

## Task Overview
Establish the foundational infrastructure for the AURA-004 coding agent including LangGraph integration, vector database setup, and core package structure.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] LangGraph state management system operational
- [ ] ChromaDB vector database configured and tested
- [ ] Tree-sitter multi-language code parsing functional
- [ ] Basic project structure and dependencies installed
- [ ] Core agent framework with state transitions working

## Technical Specifications
- LangGraph v0.0.30+ for state management
- ChromaDB v0.4.x for vector storage
- Tree-sitter v0.20.x for code parsing
- Poetry for dependency management
- Python 3.9+ compatibility

## Implementation Tasks
1. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Create pyproject.toml with all dependencies
   - Set up Python package structure
   - Configure development environment

2. **LangGraph Integration**
   - Implement state management schema
   - Create agent state graph
   - Add persistence and checkpointing

3. **Vector Database Setup**
   - Configure ChromaDB with collections
   - Implement embedding pipeline
   - Add indexing and search capabilities

4. **Code Parsing Framework**
   - Set up Tree-sitter for multiple languages
   - Implement AST extraction
   - Create code chunking strategies

## Dependencies
- LangGraph core components
- Vector search architecture research
- Package dependencies analysis
- Open source packaging requirements

## Timeline
**Duration**: 3-4 days
**Start**: Day 1
**Dependencies**: Research completion (AURA-004)

## Deliverables
- Working core infrastructure
- Test suite with >80% coverage
- Documentation for setup and configuration
- Performance benchmarks

## Quality Gates
- All core tests passing
- Performance targets met (<100ms state updates)
- Code quality standards compliance
- Documentation completeness

## Risk Mitigation
- Dependency version conflicts resolved
- Performance bottlenecks identified and addressed
- Compatibility testing across Python versions
- Backup strategies for data persistence
