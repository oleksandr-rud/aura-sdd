# AURA Coding Agent - Quality Gates and Validation Criteria

## Document Information
- **Project**: AURA-004 Open Source Release
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Date**: 2025-10-27
- **Author**: Tech Lead Agent
- **Status**: Ready for Implementation
- **Purpose**: Define quality standards and validation checkpoints

## Overview

This document defines the quality gates and validation criteria for the AURA coding agent open source release. Quality gates are mandatory checkpoints that must be passed before proceeding to the next phase of development. Each gate includes specific criteria, validation methods, and success metrics.

### Quality Gate Philosophy

**Quality-First Development**: Every phase must meet defined quality standards before progression
**Automated Validation**: Where possible, quality checks should be automated and integrated into CI/CD
**Evidence-Based Decisions**: Go/No-Go decisions must be supported by objective metrics and evidence
**Continuous Improvement**: Quality standards should evolve based on feedback and lessons learned
