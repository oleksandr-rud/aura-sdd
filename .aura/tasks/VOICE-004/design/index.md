## Design Decisions Log
| Date | Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 2025-10-27 | Use hybrid STT approach (local + cloud) | Balance accuracy, privacy, and offline capability | Requires dual architecture design |
| 2025-10-27 | Integrate with existing AURA agents | Leverage mature framework, avoid reinvention | Complex integration but faster development |
| 2025-10-27 | Prioritize web platform first | Largest user base, easier deployment | Mobile/desktop require additional effort |
| 2025-10-27 | Use Web Speech API as primary | Native browser support, no dependencies | Limited browser compatibility fallbacks needed |
