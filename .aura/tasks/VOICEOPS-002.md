# VoiceOps AI Integration - Multi-Provider RAG Enhancement

DOMAIN: AI Integration & Agentic RPA
STATUS: in_progress
OWNER: tech-lead
LAST UPDATED: 2025-10-26T16:45:00+03:00

## Product Brief

### Problem
VoiceOps Assistant needs enhanced AI capabilities for complex decision-making, contextual understanding, and intelligent RPA workflow orchestration. Current rule-based intent recognition is limited to predefined patterns and cannot handle nuanced user requests or learn from interaction history.

### Goals
— Integrate multiple AI providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Gemini Pro, GLM-4) for intelligent intent processing and RPA planning
— Implement agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with Qdrant vector database and PostgreSQL knowledge base
— Create persistent conversation history and analytics for personalized voice automation
— Enable AI-powered workflow generation that can create new RPA sequences dynamically
— Achieve contextual understanding of user preferences and environment state

### Success Metrics
— 95% accuracy for complex, multi-step intent understanding (vs 85% rule-based)
— 50ms response time for AI-powered intent processing (including RAG retrieval)
— 1000+ document knowledge base with semantic search capabilities
— Dynamic workflow generation for 80% of user requests outside predefined intents
— 90% user satisfaction with AI-suggested automation sequences
— 99.9% uptime for AI services with automatic failover between providers

### Constraints & Notes
Architecture: Multi-provider AI orchestration with intelligent routing and fallback
Delivery: Integration with existing VoiceOps pipeline without breaking changes
Compliance/Security: Local AI processing preferred, cloud options with explicit consent, vector encryption for sensitive data
Performance: Sub-100ms response for simple queries, <500ms for complex RAG-augmented responses

### Attached Context
.voiceops-001.md — Base VoiceOps architecture and intent system
.ai-integration-design.md — Multi-provider AI architecture specifications
.rag-knowledge-base.md — Document ingestion and retrieval strategy
.voiceops-performance.md — Performance benchmarks and latency targets
