DOMAIN: Enterprise Architecture & System Integration
STATUS: in_progress
OWNER: architect
LAST UPDATED: 2025-10-26T18:15:00+03:00

## Product Brief

### Problem
VoiceOps Assistant has evolved into a complex multi-service architecture with separate components (STT, RPA, AI services, RAG engine, workflow generator) that need architectural unification for enterprise deployment, maintainability, and scalability.

### Goals
— Design unified VoiceOps architecture using fractal projection principles
— Create reusable kit that can be applied to multiple enterprise applications
— Establish clear separation of concerns with shared constitution and governance
— Enable independent deployment of VoiceOps components while maintaining architectural coherence
— Provide enterprise-ready patterns for voice automation across different business domains

### Success Metrics
— 90% code reuse across different VoiceOps application deployments
— Sub-30min deployment time for new VoiceOps instances using reusable kit
— 100% architectural compliance across all VoiceOps applications
— 50% reduction in onboarding time for new VoiceOps development teams
— Enterprise-grade scalability supporting 10,000+ concurrent users

### Constraints & Notes
Architecture: Fractal projection with shared constitution, glossary, and registry across apps
Delivery: Modular deployment with independent component lifecycles and unified governance
Compliance/Security: Enterprise security standards with audit trails and role-based access
Scalability: Horizontal scaling with microservices architecture and load balancing

### Attached Context
.voiceops-001.md — Base VoiceOps architecture and intent system
.voiceops-002.md — AI integration and RAG capabilities
.architecture-review.md — Current system architecture analysis
.enterprise-requirements.md — Business requirements for enterprise deployment

## Implementation Artifacts

### Fractal Architecture

#### Core Design Principles
- **Shared Constitution**: Common governance, principles, and standards across all VoiceOps applications
- **Fractal Projection**: Each application inherits and extends root kit with domain-specific adaptations
- **Component Independence**: Services can be deployed and maintained independently while following shared architecture
- **Registry Synchronization**: Shared skill and concept registry with application-specific extensions

### Deployment Architecture

#### Unified Deployment Patterns
- **Microservices**: Each component deployable independently with Docker/Kubernetes
- **Service Mesh**: Istio or Linkerd for service discovery and traffic management
- **Configuration Management**: Externalized configuration with Helm charts
- **Monitoring**: Unified observability with Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger

#### Environment Strategy
```

```

### Governance Model

#### Constitution Hierarchy
1. **Root Constitution**: Core principles, workflow standards, quality gates
2. **Domain Constitution**: Industry/domain-specific adaptations
3. **Application Constitution**: Application-specific rules and constraints

#### Registry Management
- **Shared Registry**: Common skills, concepts, and workflow patterns
- **Extension Registry**: Application-specific additions and specializations
