# VoiceOps Assistant - Hands-Free PC Control System

DOMAIN: Voice Automation & RPA
STATUS: in_progress
OWNER: product-ops
LAST UPDATED: 2025-10-26T15:30:00+03:00

## Product Brief

### Problem
Users need hands-free control of their PC for accessibility, productivity, and convenience. Current voice assistants are limited to simple commands and don't integrate with desktop automation capabilities.

### Goals
— Deliver wake-word/PTT → STT → intent recognition → safe RPA action execution pipeline by Q1 2025
— Achieve 95% accuracy for common desktop automation commands (open apps, file management, web navigation)
— Support cross-platform deployment (Windows/macOS/Linux) with platform-specific adapters
— Enable delegation through LangGraph for complex multi-step workflows requiring human judgment

### Success Metrics
— <200ms end-to-end latency for simple commands (wake-word to action completion)
— 99% safety record - no unintended destructive actions in beta testing
— 50+ supported intent categories covering common desktop workflows
— 90% user satisfaction score in accessibility testing with disabled users
— <5% false wake-word activation rate in noisy environments

### Constraints & Notes
Architecture: Modular microservices with STT service, intent recognition, RPA engine, and delegation graph
Delivery: MVP with core intents by Sprint 3, full delegation capabilities by Sprint 6
Compliance/Security: Local processing only, no cloud data transmission, explicit user consent for all RPA actions
Platform Support: Primary Windows, secondary macOS/Linux support

### Attached Context
.canvas/voiceops-blueprint.md — Complete system architecture and component specifications
docs/voice-assistant-research.md — Market analysis and competitive landscape
docs/accessibility-requirements.md — WCAG compliance and accessibility testing protocols

- Noise cancellation and audio preprocessing

#### 2. Intent Recognition Engine
- Grammar-based intent parsing for high accuracy
- Machine learning fallback for ambiguous commands
- Confidence thresholding for safety

- Safe automation sandbox with explicit permissions
- Action validation and confirmation requirements
- Undo/rollback capabilities for destructive actions
- Audit logging for all executed actions

#### 4. Platform Adapters

- macOS: AppleScript and Accessibility API
- Linux: X11/Wayland and command-line automation
- Unified abstraction layer for cross-platform compatibility

#### 5. LangGraph Delegation System
- Complex workflow decomposition

### Safety Architecture

#### Confidence Thresholds
- STT confidence > 90% for simple commands
- Intent confidence > 85% for non-destructive actions
- RPA confirmation required for file operations
- Human validation for system-level changes

#### Permission Model
- User-granted permissions for application control
- Explicit opt-in for file system access
- Sandbox isolation for web automation
- Audit trail for all permission changes

#### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation for unrecognized commands
- Safe fallback for low confidence scenarios
- Emergency stop mechanism via hotkey
- Rollback capabilities for executed actions

### Performance Targets

#### Latency Requirements
- Wake word detection: <100ms
- STT processing: <500ms for typical commands
- Intent parsing: <50ms
- RPA execution: <200ms for simple actions
- End-to-end latency: <1s for common workflows

#### Accuracy Requirements
- Wake word false positive rate: <5%
- STT word error rate: <10% for clear speech
- Intent recognition accuracy: >95%
- RPA execution success rate: >99%

### Integration Points

#### External Services
- Local STT engine (no cloud dependencies)
- System accessibility APIs
- Application automation frameworks
- File system and process management APIs

#### Development Tools
- Docker Compose for local development
- Automated testing pipeline
- Performance monitoring and profiling
