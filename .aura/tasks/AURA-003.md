## Product Brief
### Problem
Current AI coding assistants have fundamental limitations in knowledge management, context understanding, and platform integration. They lack advanced RAG capabilities, deep integration with development ecosystems, and the ability to generate and manage their own operational infrastructure (agents, skills, tasks, knowledge bases). Furthermore, existing solutions don't leverage intelligent indexing and knowledge graph technologies for superior context understanding and retrieval.

### Goals
- Develop a next-generation AI coding agent with advanced AURA framework integration
- Implement sophisticated RAG/Graph RAG/Code RAG systems for enhanced context understanding
- Create intelligent knowledge management with smart indexing strategies
- Build self-generating capabilities for agents, skills, tasks, glossary, and constitution
- Establish vector/graph database integration for intelligent knowledge retrieval
- Enable custom tool integration and advanced knowledge segmentation algorithms
- Create a platform that learns, adapts, and generates its own operational components

### Success Metrics

### Constraints
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing AURA framework architecture
- Must maintain compatibility with existing development tools and workflows
- Must ensure enterprise-grade security and data governance
- Must support scalable deployment for large codebases and teams
- Must provide extensible architecture for future enhancements

## Rolling Summary
**Current State**: Research complete with comprehensive validation from both product and architect agents. Strong market opportunity ($50B+ by 2030) confirmed, technical feasibility validated, and clear implementation path established. Ready for go/no-go decision.

**Next Steps**: Review research findings, secure Series A funding ($8M), and begin core team hiring for Phase 1 development.
