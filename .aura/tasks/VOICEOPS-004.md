OWNER: product-ops
LAST UPDATED: 2025-10-26T19:45:00+03:00

## Product Brief

### Problem
Users need to experience the VoiceOps Assistant capabilities through a compelling demo that showcases the integration between voice-controlled RPA and the agent orchestration system. The demo must highlight safe automation, delegation workflows, and multi-agent collaboration.

### Goals
— Create interactive demo scenarios demonstrating VoiceOps integration
— Showcase wake-word → STT → intent recognition → agent delegation → RPA execution pipeline
— Demonstrate human-in-the-loop workflows with RunCard and ticket creation
— Provide hands-on experience for stakeholders with safety-first automation
— Validate performance metrics and user experience in controlled environment

### Success Metrics
— 100% success rate for all demo scenarios (no failures during presentation)
— <500ms average latency for simple voice commands during demo
— 90+ user satisfaction score from stakeholder feedback
— Complete safety validation with zero unintended actions
— Seamless agent handoffs demonstrated across all personas

### Constraints & Notes
Demo Environment: Controlled sandbox with pre-configured applications and test data
Safety Requirements: All destructive actions must have explicit confirmation and rollback
Audience: Technical stakeholders, product managers, and accessibility partners
Duration: 30-minute interactive demo with Q&A session
Platform Support: Windows primary demonstration with macOS/Linux documentation

## Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Simple Voice Commands (Product Ops Agent)
**Workflow**: Voice command → Intent recognition → Direct RPA execution
**Commands**:
- "Hey VoiceOps, open Chrome and navigate to github.com"
- "Hey VoiceOps, create a new folder named 'demo-project' on desktop"
- "Hey VoiceOps, take a screenshot of the current window"

**Integration**: Product Ops agent validates requirements and confirms safety constraints

### Scenario 2: Complex Workflow with Delegation (Tech Lead Agent)
**Workflow**: Voice command → Intent parsing → Tech Lead delegation → Task breakdown → RPA execution
**Commands**:
- "Hey VoiceOps, set up a development environment for a new Python project"
- "Hey VoiceOps, organize my downloads folder by file type and date"
- "Hey VoiceOps, create a backup of my documents folder to external drive"

**Integration**: Tech Lead agent creates implementation plan with validation gates

### Scenario 3: Multi-Agent Collaboration (Architect + QA Agents)
**Workflow**: Complex request → Architect assessment → QA validation → Execution
**Commands**:
- "Hey VoiceOps, analyze my system security settings and recommend improvements"
- "Hey VoiceOps, optimize my development workflow for better productivity"
- "Hey VoiceOps, create automated testing setup for my current project"

**Integration**: Architect agent designs solution, QA agent validates safety and compliance

### Scenario 4: Human-in-the-Loop with RunCard (All Agents)
**Workflow**: Critical action → Multi-agent validation → Human confirmation → Execution
**Commands**:
- "Hey VoiceOps, install system updates after verifying compatibility"
- "Hey VoiceOps, migrate my development environment to new machine"
- "Hey VoiceOps, archive old projects and clean up system storage"

**Integration**: Full agent orchestra with RunCard creation and stakeholder approval

## Demo Requirements

### Technical Setup
1. **VoiceOps Sandbox Environment**
   - Pre-configured Windows 11 VM with demo applications
   - Sample files and folders for organization scenarios
   - Development environment with VS Code, Python, Node.js
   - External drive simulation for backup demonstrations

2. **Agent Integration**
   - Running agents (product-ops, tech-lead, architect, qa)
   - Agent communication channels and handoff protocols
   - Task tracking and lifecycle management
   - Real-time agent status visualization

3. **Audio Configuration**
   - High-quality microphone for wake-word detection
   - Noise cancellation for clear STT processing
   - Visual feedback for voice recognition status
   - Fallback text input for demonstration reliability

### Safety Measures
1. **Permission Controls**
   - Explicit user consent for all RPA actions
   - Read-only mode for system analysis scenarios
   - Confirmation dialogs for file operations
   - Emergency stop hotkey (Ctrl+Alt+Break)

2. **Rollback Capabilities**
   - Automatic backup before file operations
   - System restore points for configuration changes
   - Undo functionality for all executed actions
   - Complete audit trail logging

3. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful failure modes for all scenarios
   - Clear error messages and recovery instructions
   - Fallback manual intervention procedures
   - Real-time status monitoring and alerts
