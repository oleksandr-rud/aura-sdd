# API Service Constitution

## Mission
Expose domain services over HTTP with intelligent automation and dynamic spec governance, enabling client apps and partner integrations to iterate safely with real-time quality monitoring.

## Constitution Apps Framework

### App Configuration
```yaml
App ID: api-service
App Type: REST API Service
Version: {{current-version}}
Last Updated: {{current-date}}

```

### Agent Orchestration
```yaml
Primary Agents:
  - tech-lead-orchestrator: Engineering execution and API development
  - architect-orchestrator: API design and architecture decisions
  - qa-orchestrator: API quality assurance and contract testing
  - product-ops-orchestrator: API roadmap and stakeholder coordination

Skill Execution:
  Development: [api-development, code-quality, devops-automation]
  Quality: [qa-testing, research-analysis]
  Architecture: [architect-plan]
  Management: [context-compact]
```

## Architectural Tenets
- **ü§ñ Intelligent API Development**: Auto-generated endpoints with dynamic scaffolding
- **üìä Contract-First Design**: OpenAPI/Zod contracts with automatic client generation
- **üîß Modular Architecture**: Layered modules with clear separation of concerns
- **‚ö° Performance Optimization**: Intelligent caching and response optimization
- **üõ°Ô∏è Security by Design**: Automated security scanning and compliance checking

```

## Security & Compliance
```yaml
Security Measures:
  HTTPS Enforcement: Via reverse proxy
  Input Validation: Zod schema validation
  PII Redaction: Automatic logging redaction
  Secret Management: Vault/Kubernetes secrets
  Rate Limiting: Per-client limits
  CORS: Configured origins

Compliance Standards:
  {{compliance-framework}} compliance
  Audit logging enabled
  Data retention policies enforced
  Security scans automated
```

## Risk & Mitigation
```yaml
Risk Management:
  Schema Drift:
    Risk: High
    Mitigation: Auto-generated clients + backward-compat tests
    Status: {{mitigation-status}}

  Blocking I/O:
    Risk: Medium
    Mitigation: Async worker queue integration
    Status: {{mitigation-status}}

  Performance Degradation:
    Risk: Medium
    Mitigation: Real-time monitoring + auto-scaling
    Status: {{mitigation-status}}

  Security Vulnerabilities:
    Risk: High
    Mitigation: Automated scanning + rapid patching
    Status: {{mitigation-status}}
```

## Dynamic Skill Integration
```yaml
API Development Pipeline:
  1. architect-plan: Design API architecture and contracts
  2. api-development: Generate endpoints and implementation
  3. code-quality: Review and validate code quality
  4. qa-testing: Execute comprehensive API testing
  5. devops-automation: Deploy and monitor API service
  6. research-analysis: Analyze performance and usage metrics
  7. context-compact: Maintain clean documentation
