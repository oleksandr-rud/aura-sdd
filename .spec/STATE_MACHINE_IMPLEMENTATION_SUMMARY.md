# State Machine Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive update to implement the State Machine Transition Mechanism (SDD) across the Spec Gen monorepo. The implementation establishes a structured workflow that governs all persona deliverables through the Orient → Scope → Execute → Gate sequence.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Template Updates

#### Task Template (`.spec/templates/task-template.md`)
**Before**: Dynamic task template with multiple sections (Header, Product Brief, Rolling Summary, Implementation Notes, Testing Notes, Metrics & Evidence, Activity Log)

**After**: State Machine template with:
- Simplified Header (DOMAIN, STATUS, OWNER, LAST UPDATED)
- Streamlined Product Brief (Problem, Goals, Success Metrics, Constraints, Attached Context)
- **Lifecycle Log**: Centralized story log with structured transition entries
- Template usage guidelines with gate order and transition modes

#### Skill Template (`.spec/templates/skill-template.md`)
**Before**: BMAD-inspired interactive guidance with traditional skill structure

**After**: State Machine transition mechanism with:
- **ORIENTATION** checks (constitution, glossary, persona brief)
- **LIFECYCLE TRANSITION** configuration (from/to states, gate tags)
- **EXECUTION ALGORITHM** with prerequisite validation
- **ARTIFACT OUTPUT** standardization
- **TRANSITION LOG TEMPLATE** with structured format
- **BLOCKED FORMAT** for missing prerequisites

#### Agent Template (`.spec/templates/agent-template.md`)
**Before**: BMAD-inspired workflow integration guidance

**After**: Persona prompt scaffold with:
- **IDENTITY** configuration (id, mission, success_criteria, mcp_tools)
- **ORIENTATION CHECKS** for alignment
- **MANDATE & BOUNDS** definition
- **STATES & SKILLS** authorization mapping
- **OPERATING PRINCIPLES** for workflow compliance

- **Quality and Compliance Terms**: Guardrails and standards

**Updated Legacy Terms**: Integrated existing terminology with SDD compatibility

#### Constitution (`.spec/constitution.md`)
**Complete Rewrite** (Version 3.0):
- **State Machine Workflow** as controlling workflow
- **Gate Order** with prescribed sequence (9 transitions)
- **Transition Execution Standards** with modes and formats
- **Architecture and Engineering Standards**

- **Skill System** mapped to gate transitions
- **Communication Standards** updated for Lifecycle Log format

### 4. Key Features Implemented

#### State Machine Transition Mechanism
- **Orient → Scope → Execute → Gate** mandatory sequence
- **Prescribed Gate Order**: 9 structured transitions
- **Transition Modes**: strict, tolerant, branch
- **Lifecycle Log**: Centralized metadata capture

#### Structured Transition Format
```markdown
[TRANSITION|<gate.tag>] by <persona>
MODE: strict|tolerant|branch
FROM_STATE: <current_state>
TO_STATE: <target_state>
WHY:
- <concise bullet 1>
- <concise bullet 2>
OUTPUT:
=== <GATE_NAME> ===
summary: <concise summary>
inputs: <key references or n/a>
evidence: |result=<pass/fail>|ref=<artifact_path>
risks: [ ]|owner=<persona>|mitigation=<action>
next_steps: <follow-up needed or n/a>
=== END <GATE_NAME> ===
FOLLOW-UP:
- owner=<persona> - due=<date>
```

#### BLOCKED Protocol
```markdown
BLOCKED(missing_inputs=[prerequisite1, prerequisite2], unblock_steps=[step1, step2])
```

#### Quality Guardrails
- **CLI Readability**: ≤120 chars per line
- **Evidence Citation**: Actionable references (ref=path#Lx or URLs)
- **Risk Escalation**: Defined protocols for scope gaps and technical risks
- **Documentation Updates**: Mandatory updates to glossary/constitution

### 5. Gate Order Implementation

1. **product.discovery** → Validate problem and market need
2. **product.prd** → Capture requirements and acceptance criteria
3. **agile.planning** → Sequence backlog and allocate capacity
4. **code.implement** → Build feature with automated tests
5. **code.review** → Verify code quality and architecture compliance
6. **qa.ready** → Prepare test environment and fixtures
7. **qa.contract** → Validate API/event contracts
8. **qa.e2e** → Verify end-to-end user journeys
9. **pm.sync** → Update stakeholders and close story

### 6. Persona Simplification

**Before**: Complex orchestrator naming (architect-orchestrator, product-ops-orchestrator, etc.)

**After**: Simplified naming (architect, product-ops, tech-lead, qa)

**Universal Requirements for All Personas**:
- Perform orientation checks before executing transitions
- Follow prescribed gate order without deviation
- Use standardized transition log format
- Maintain CLI readability constraints
- Escalate scope gaps through proper channels

### 7. Context Management

#### New Skills
- **context-snapshot**: Capture status before/after handoffs
- **context-compact**: Manage Lifecycle Log size

#### Context Pack Structure
- `<<story.current_state>>`
- `<<personas.active_assignments>>`
- `<<recent_transition_log>>`
- `<<<GLOSSARY(term=...)>>>` lookups

### 8. Quality and Compliance Standards

#### Documentation Requirements
- All transitions must be documented in Lifecycle Log
- Evidence must be embedded directly in task files
- Risk owners and mitigation strategies must be explicit
- Decision rationale must be clearly documented

#### Engineering Standards
- Async/Await patterns for service interactions
- Repository helpers for data access
- Structured logging across services
- Backward compatibility for payload changes
- Redis channel validation for pub/sub operations

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts
