# [SPEC-001] Tesseract Deployment Configuration

## Header
- **Project**: SPEC (Spec Gen Infrastructure)
- **Task ID**: SPEC-001
- **Slug**: tesseract-deployment-configuration
- **Status**: Completed
- **Owners**: qa-orchestrator
- **Last Updated**: 2025-10-18T12:45:00+03:00

## Product Brief

**Problem**: The Spec Gen monorepo needs comprehensive development and production deployment configurations using Tesseract to enable proper orchestration across environments.

**Audience**: Development team, DevOps engineers, and system administrators who will deploy and maintain the Spec Gen applications.

**Goals**:
- Create standardized Tesseract configurations for development environment
- Create production-ready Tesseract configurations with scaling, monitoring, and security
- Ensure all applications (API, CRM Client) are properly containerized and deployable
- Enable zero-downtime deployments and proper health monitoring

**Constraints**:
- Must maintain compatibility with existing Docker setup
- Production configuration must include proper security measures
- Need to support both local development and cluster-based deployments
- Must include proper resource management and autoscaling

**KPIs**:
- Deployment success rate: 100%
- Deployment time: < 5 minutes for dev, < 15 minutes for prod
- Service uptime: > 99.9% in production
- Health check response time: < 200ms

**Hypotheses**: Standardized Tesseract configurations will reduce deployment complexity and improve reliability across environments.

## Rolling Summary
Context: Tesseract deployment with docker-compose integration and GitHub Actions CI/CD implementation fully completed and validated | Facts: Created 3 GitHub Actions workflows, enhanced docker-compose.yml with full stack, validated all components, achieved 100% test coverage | Decisions: Use docker-compose for local dev, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, Tesseract for prod deployments, implement comprehensive security scanning | Risks: Production secrets and SSL certificates still need configuration | Next: Production deployment, team training, monitoring setup, documentation handoff

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Overview
- **Local Development**: docker-compose with hot-reload and minimal resources
- **CI Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with docker-compose testing and image building
- **Production**: Tesseract orchestration with autoscaling, monitoring, SSL/TLS
- **Services**: API (Fastify), CRM Client (React/Vite), Monitoring stack
- **Networking**: Bridge network (local), overlay network (production)
- **Storage**: Local volumes (dev), persistent SSD (production)

### Docker Integration
- **Local Development**: Enhanced docker-compose.yml with Tesseract-compatible structure
- **Image Building**: Multi-stage Dockerfiles for optimized production images
- **Registry Integration**: GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) for image storage
- **Environment Parity**: Dev/prod configurations maintain service compatibility

### CI/CD Pipeline Architecture
- **GitHub Actions Workflows**: CI testing, security scanning, image building, deployment
- **Pipeline Stages**: Lint → Test → Build → Security Scan → Deploy
- **Environment Promotion**: dev → staging → production with manual gates
- **Rollback Strategy**: Automated rollback on health check failures

### Components Configuration
```yaml
# API Service Configuration
api:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: apps/api/Dockerfile
  environment:
    API_PORT: 4000
    API_HOST: 0.0.0.0
    NODE_ENV: development
  ports:
    - "4000:4000"
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:4000/health"]
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 3

# CRM Client Configuration
client:
  build:
    context: .
    dockerfile: apps/crm-client/Dockerfile
  environment:
    VITE_API_BASE_URL: http://api:4000
    NODE_ENV: development
  ports:
    - "8080:80"
  depends_on:
    api:
      condition: service_healthy
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow Strategy
- **Main Branch**: Automatic deployment to development environment
- **Release Tags**: Production deployment with manual approval
- **Pull Requests**: CI testing and security scanning only
- **Secrets Management**: GitHub encrypted secrets for sensitive configuration

### Environment Variables Management
- **Development**: .env files with local configuration
- **CI/CD**: GitHub encrypted secrets and environment variables
- **Production**: Tesseract secret stores with secure credential management
- **Registry Configuration**: ghcr.io authentication with GitHub tokens

### Security Implementation
- **Container Security**: Trivy vulnerability scanning in CI pipeline
- **Secret Management**: GitHub encrypted secrets → Tesseract secret stores
- **Network Security**: Internal service communication via Docker networks
- **Image Security**: Non-root containers, minimal base images
