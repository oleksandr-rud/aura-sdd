## Activity Log

2025-10-18T19:15:00+03:00 - product-ops-orchestrator - Created SPEC-002 task for template system enhancement with BMAD integration, gathered requirements from BMAD research, defined comprehensive product brief with clear goals and KPIs

2025-10-18T19:45:00+03:00 - product-ops-orchestrator - Enhanced SPEC-002 with comprehensive product ops review: validated and expanded SMART goals with specific measurable targets, refined KPIs into comprehensive adoption/user experience/business impact/agent performance/system quality metrics, enhanced implementation notes with product-first architecture and user-centric design principles, improved testing strategy with product validation framework and user experience criteria, updated rolling summary with product ops insights, added comprehensive product lifecycle considerations including UX improvements from BMAD integration, adoption strategy for new features, risk mitigation framework, success metrics focused on actual user value, and strategic product lifecycle planning

2025-10-18T20:30:00+03:00 - architect-orchestrator - Completed comprehensive architectural review and validation of SPEC-002: validated BMAD integration technical feasibility with zero-breaking-change architecture, designed template processing engine with <2s performance targets and multi-level caching, established security framework with defense-in-depth principles, defined scalable architecture supporting 1000+ concurrent operations, documented architectural decisions (ARCH-001 through ARCH-006) with trade-off analysis, enhanced risk mitigation strategies with technical architecture perspectives, updated rolling summary with architectural insights and technical implementation requirements, validated cross-environment compatibility through container architecture, confirmed integration patterns with existing agent and skill systems, and established comprehensive technical requirements for implementation phase

2025-10-18T21:30:00+03:00 - tech-lead-orchestrator - UNDONE SPEC-002 implementation due to constraint of not being able to add new files: removed technical preferences system (.spec/data/), workflow definitions (.spec/workflows/), bundle builder system (.spec/tools/), and reverted glossary (.spec/glossary.md) to original state; BMAD insights and architectural planning remain valuable for future template enhancements within existing file structure constraints; research and planning成果 can be applied to enhance existing templates without creating new files
