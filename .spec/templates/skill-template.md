# Skill Template

## **Quick Start Guide**

**For New Skills**: Follow this template structure exactly. All sections are required for complete skill definitions.

**Interactive Guidance**: This template includes helpful notes and examples to guide your skill creation.

**Template Variables**: You can use variables like `{{agent-name}}`, `{{skill-type}}`, and `{{context}}` to personalize content.

## **Abstract Structure & Format**

### **Filename Convention**
`skillname.skill.md`
*üí° **Tip**: Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the skill's purpose and function.*

### **Core Structure (Sequential Order)**

```markdown
skillname.skill

## **Purpose**
*[1-2 sentences describing what the skill does and transforms]*
*Focus on the transformation: What input becomes what output?*

## **Target Agent**
*[Specific agent(s) who should use this skill]*
*Example: tech-lead-orchestrator, product-ops-orchestrator, or multiple agents*

## **Trigger Scenarios**
*When should this skill be used? Be specific about the situations and contexts.*
- **[Category 1]**: [When to use this skill - specific situation]

## **Skill Creation Guide**

### üöÄ **Quick Start Steps**
1. **Define the Purpose**: What transformation does this skill provide?
2. **Identify the Target Agent**: Who will use this skill?
3. **Map the Trigger Scenarios**: When should this skill be used?
4. **Design the SOP**: What steps should the agent follow?
5. **Define Parameters**: What information does the skill need?
6. **Set Quality Standards**: How do we know the skill worked correctly?

### üìù **Skill Creation Best Practices**

#### **Purpose Definition**
- Focus on transformation: What input becomes what output?
- Keep it concise (1-2 sentences maximum)
- Use action verbs: "Analyzes", "Creates", "Validates", "Transforms"
- Be specific about the value provided

#### **Target Agent Selection**
- Be specific: "tech-lead-orchestrator" vs "agents"
- Consider agent capabilities and responsibilities
- Ensure the agent has access to required tools
- Think about handoff patterns and coordination

#### **Trigger Scenarios**
- Think from the user's perspective: "When would I need this?"
- Include both proactive and reactive scenarios
- Consider the context: project type, task state, user needs
- Be specific about conditions and requirements

#### **SOP Design**
- Use logical phases: Analysis ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Validation
- Keep steps actionable and specific
- Include documentation and logging responsibilities
- Consider error handling and edge cases
- Limit to 4 phases with 4 steps each for clarity

#### **Parameter Definition**
- Use descriptive, snake_case names
- Specify exact format requirements
- Provide realistic, helpful examples
