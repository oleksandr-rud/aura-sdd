# Task Best Practices & Patterns

## Abstracted from SPEC-001: Tesseract Deployment Configuration

### Core Success Patterns

#### 1. Task Structure Excellence
**Pattern**: Comprehensive single-file documentation approach
- **Evidence**: SPEC-001 maintained all information within the single task file
- **Benefit**: Complete traceability, no scattered artifacts, easy handoffs
- **Implementation**: Use structured sections with clear hierarchy and embedded evidence

**Pattern**: Rolling summary for continuous context management
- **Evidence**: SPEC-001's rolling summary evolved from initial context through implementation
- **Benefit**: New team members can quickly understand current state without reading entire history
- **Implementation**: Update rolling summary with each major milestone: Context | Facts | Decisions | Risks | Next

#### 2. Planning & Requirements
**Pattern**: Clear problem-audience-goals-constraints-KPIs structure
- **Evidence**: SPEC-001's product brief provided clear direction and success criteria
- **Benefit**: Prevents scope creep, enables stakeholder alignment, facilitates objective evaluation
- **Implementation**: Spend adequate time on product brief before technical implementation

**Pattern**: Specific, measurable KPIs with targets
- **Evidence**: SPEC-001 defined deployment time <15 minutes, uptime >99.9%, response time <200ms
- **Benefit**: Creates objective success criteria, enables data-driven decisions
- **Implementation**: Define KPIs that can be quantitatively measured and validated

#### 3. Implementation Excellence
**Pattern**: Architecture overview with multiple environment support
- **Evidence**: SPEC-001 provided clear architecture for local dev, CI/CD, and production
- **Benefit**: Ensures consistency across environments, reduces deployment risks
- **Implementation**: Document architecture patterns for each environment with configuration examples

**Pattern**: Security-by-design integration
- **Evidence**: SPEC-001 integrated Trivy scanning, secret management, and container security
- **Benefit**: Reduces security debt, enables compliance, prevents production issues
- **Implementation**: Include security considerations in every phase, not as afterthought

#### 4. Testing Strategy Excellence
**Pattern**: Multi-layered testing approach with clear status tracking
- **Evidence**: SPEC-001 used unit, integration, contract, e2e, and stress testing with completion tracking
- **Benefit**: Comprehensive quality assurance, clear visibility into test coverage
- **Implementation**: Plan testing across all levels, track completion with checkboxes and status summaries

**Pattern**: Evidence-based testing results
- **Evidence**: SPEC-001 included specific metrics (145ms response time, 100% test coverage)
- **Benefit**: Objective validation of quality, data-driven go/no-go decisions
- **Implementation**: Capture quantitative results for all test categories

#### 5. Documentation Excellence
**Pattern**: Activity log with append-only approach
- **Evidence**: SPEC-001 maintained chronological log without modifying existing entries
- **Benefit**: Complete audit trail, preserves decision context, enables post-mortem analysis
- **Implementation**: Use timestamp + agent + description format, never modify existing entries

**Pattern**: Comprehensive final deliverables summary
- **Evidence**: SPEC-001's final section provided complete overview of achievements and next steps
- **Benefit**: Facilitates handoffs, enables stakeholder communication, supports process improvement
- **Implementation**: Structure final summary with completed work, test results, readiness checklists

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

#### 1. Incomplete Requirements
**Anti-Pattern**: Starting technical work without clear success criteria
- **Risk**: Scope creep, rework, stakeholder misalignment
- **Prevention**: Complete product brief before implementation begins

#### 2. Scattered Documentation
**Anti-Pattern**: Creating multiple files and artifacts for a single task
- **Risk**: Information fragmentation, lost context, difficult handoffs
- **Prevention**: Use single-file documentation approach with embedded evidence

#### 3. Unclear Decision Context
**Anti-Pattern**: Making decisions without documenting rationale
- **Risk**: Lost knowledge, repeated mistakes, inability to learn
- **Prevention**: Document all decisions with context, alternatives considered, and rationale

#### 4. Inadequate Testing
**Anti-Pattern**: Focusing only on functional testing
- **Risk**: Production issues, performance problems, security vulnerabilities
- **Prevention**: Plan comprehensive testing across all levels from the beginning

#### 5. Missing Success Metrics
**Anti-Pattern**: Not defining measurable success criteria
- **Risk**: Subjective evaluation, inability to validate completion
- **Prevention**: Define specific, measurable KPIs with targets and validation methods

### Execution Patterns

#### 1. Agent Coordination
**Pattern**: Clear orchestrator ownership with specialist handoffs
- **Evidence**: SPEC-001 showed clear ownership transitions between agents
- **Benefit**: Efficient resource utilization, clear accountability
- **Implementation**: Define orchestrator responsibilities and handoff procedures

#### 2. Progress Management
**Pattern**: Continuous Rolling Summary updates
- **Evidence**: SPEC-001's rolling summary evolved through implementation phases
- **Benefit**: Real-time status visibility, quick onboarding for new participants
- **Implementation**: Update rolling summary with each significant milestone

#### 3. Quality Assurance
**Pattern**: Embedded evidence collection throughout process
- **Evidence**: SPEC-001 collected metrics and evidence during implementation, not just at end
- **Benefit**: Continuous quality validation, early issue detection
- **Implementation**: Define evidence collection points for each implementation phase

#### 4. Risk Management
**Pattern**: Proactive risk identification and mitigation
- **Evidence**: SPEC-001 identified production secrets and SSL configuration as risks
- **Benefit**: Reduces surprise failures, enables proactive mitigation
- **Implementation**: Include risks section in rolling summary, track mitigation progress

### Measurement & Validation Patterns

#### 1. Quantitative Success Criteria
**Pattern**: All KPIs defined with specific targets and measurement methods
- **Evidence**: SPEC-001 defined deployment time, response time, uptime targets
- **Benefit**: Objective evaluation, data-driven decisions
- **Implementation**: Define measurement approach for each KPI

#### 2. Evidence-Based Validation
**Pattern**: Collect and embed evidence throughout implementation
- **Evidence**: SPEC-001 included test results, performance metrics, configuration evidence
- **Benefit**: Complete audit trail, facilitates validation and handoffs
- **Implementation**: Define evidence collection points and formats

#### 3. Continuous Status Assessment
**Pattern**: Regular status evaluation with clear go/no-go criteria
- **Evidence**: SPEC-001's testing sections included current status and next steps
- **Benefit**: Early issue detection, clear progress visibility
- **Implementation**: Define status assessment criteria and frequency

### Scalability Patterns

#### 1. Template-Based Execution
**Pattern**: Use established SOPs and templates for consistency
- **Evidence**: SPEC-001 followed established patterns for CI/CD, docker-compose, etc.
- **Benefit**: Consistent quality, reduced cognitive load, easier training
- **Implementation**: Develop and maintain SOPs for common task types

#### 2. Reusable Components
**Pattern**: Create reusable configuration and implementation patterns
- **Evidence**: SPEC-001's GitHub Actions workflows can be reused for other projects
- **Benefit**: Faster execution, consistent quality, reduced maintenance
- **Implementation**: Identify and extract reusable patterns from successful tasks

#### 3. Knowledge Transfer
**Pattern**: Document lessons learned and best practices
- **Evidence**: This best practices document abstracted from SPEC-001
- **Benefit**: Continuous improvement, organizational learning
- **Implementation**: Regularly extract and document patterns from completed tasks
