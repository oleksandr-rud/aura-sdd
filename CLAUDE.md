# Claude AI Assistant Guide for Spec Gen

## Overview

This guide serves as the comprehensive manual for Claude AI assistants working within the Spec Gen monorepo environment. It provides the necessary context, workflows, and guidelines to effectively assist with development, architecture, product management, and quality assurance tasks.

## Quick Start

### For Claude AI Assistants
1. **Load Context**: From the project root, familiarize yourself with the `.spec/` directory structure
2. **Agent Activation**: Use activation phrases to assume specific agent roles:
   - `As architect orchestrator, scope task SPEC-001`
   - `As product ops orchestrator, run product cycle for SPEC-002`
   - `As tech lead orchestrator, execute implementation for SPEC-003`
   - `As qa orchestrator, validate quality for SPEC-004`
3. **Task Management**: Record task IDs and maintain Rolling Summaries
4. **Context Reset**: Archive conclusions in Activity Log when switching tasks

### ðŸ†• **Enhanced Template Features**
The templates now include BMAD-inspired interactive guidance:
- **Template Variables**: Use `{{project-type}}`, `{{agent-name}}`, `{{current-date}}` for personalization
- **Interactive Guidance**: Built-in tips and examples in each template section
- **Quick Start Guides**: Step-by-step instructions for template usage
- **Pro Tips**: Expert guidance for best practices and common pitfalls

### Project Structure
```
.spec/
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/          # Agent specifications and workflows
â”œâ”€â”€ skills/          # Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for tasks
â”œâ”€â”€ tasks/           # Single-file task packages (PROJECT-XXX.md)

```

## Core Concepts

### Single File Documentation
- **Principle**: All evidence, metrics, and results embedded directly in task files
- **Benefit**: Complete traceability, no scattered artifacts, easy handoffs
- **Implementation**: Use markdown code blocks, structured lists, and tables within task files

### Task Package Structure
Each task follows the `PROJECT-XXX` naming convention and contains:
- **Header**: Project metadata and task identification
- **Product Brief**: Problem definition, goals, constraints, KPIs
- **Rolling Summary**: Evolving context (Context | Facts | Decisions | Risks | Next)
- **Implementation Notes**: Technical architecture and execution details
- **Testing Notes**: Multi-layered testing strategy and results
- **Metrics & Evidence**: Quantitative validation and performance data
- **Activity Log**: Chronological append-only record of all actions

### Context Management
- **Rolling Summary**: One-line status updates with clear sections
- **Activity Log**: Append-only entries with timestamps and agent attribution
- **Context Compact**: Skill to manage log size when content grows large
