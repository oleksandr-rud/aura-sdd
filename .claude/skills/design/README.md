# AURA Design Skill

## Overview

The AURA Design skill provides comprehensive design capabilities across UI/UX design, system design, architectural design, and design thinking methodologies. This skill enables agents to create user-centered designs, scalable system architectures, and effective design solutions with integration to modern design tools and prototyping capabilities.

## Capabilities

### UI/UX Design
- User research and persona development
- Information architecture and user flow design
- Wireframing and visual design
- Interactive prototyping and user testing
- Design system development and management

### System Design
- High-level system architecture design
- Component and service design
- Database and data architecture
- Security architecture patterns
- Performance optimization strategies

### Design Thinking
- Problem definition and user empathy
- Ideation and creative solution generation
- Rapid prototyping and validation
- User-centered problem solving
- Cross-functional collaboration

## Required MCPs

### Essential MCPs
1. **Figma MCP** - UI/UX design and prototyping
   ```bash
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-figma
   ```

2. **Diagram MCP** - System architecture visualization
   ```bash
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-diagrams
   ```

### Recommended MCPs
3. **Adobe Creative MCP** - Professional design tools
   ```bash
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-adobe-creative
   ```

4. **Miro MCP** - Collaborative design and brainstorming
   ```bash
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-miro
   ```

5. **Analytics MCP** - User analytics and design metrics
   ```bash
   npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-analytics
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Design Workflow
```bash
# Activate design skill
As architect, design the user interface for our new dashboard feature

# The skill will:
# 1. Analyze requirements and user needs
# 2. Create wireframes and user flows
# 3. Develop visual designs and prototypes
# 4. Conduct user testing and validation
# 5. Provide implementation-ready design specifications
```

### System Design Workflow
```bash
# System architecture design
As architect, design the microservices architecture for our e-commerce platform

# The skill will:
# 1. Analyze requirements and constraints
# 2. Design system components and interactions
# 3. Create architecture diagrams and documentation
# 4. Define APIs and data flows
# 5. Provide deployment and scaling strategies
```

## Integration

The Design skill integrates with:
- **AURA Constitution** for design standards and patterns
- **Other AURA skills** for comprehensive project workflows
- **Modern design tools** through MCP integrations
- **Development workflows** for seamless handoff to implementation

## Best Practices

1. **User-Centered Design**: Always start with user research and needs analysis
2. **Iterative Process**: Use prototypes and testing for continuous improvement
3. **Design Systems**: Leverage design systems for consistency and efficiency
4. **Accessibility**: Design for inclusive user experiences
5. **Performance**: Consider performance implications in design decisions
6. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive design documentation

## Examples

See the `examples/` directory for:
- UI/UX design examples
- System architecture diagrams
- Design system components
- User research templates
- Prototype examples
