## Integration Benefits

This example demonstrates how the Claude Code Skills format enhances the AURA system:

### Progressive Disclosure
- **Level 1**: Skill metadata loaded at startup for discovery
- **Level 2**: Instructions loaded when research is triggered
- **Level 3**: Research files and examples accessed as needed

### Context Optimization
- Only relevant research templates loaded based on research_type
- Supporting documentation accessed only when referenced
- Large research datasets stored outside context window

### Tool Integration
- WebSearch and WebFetch tools used for external research
- FileSystem tools for managing research files
- Read tools for analyzing existing documentation

### Reproducible Process
- Standardized research methodology across all research types
- Consistent documentation and evidence requirements
- Clear audit trail for all research activities
