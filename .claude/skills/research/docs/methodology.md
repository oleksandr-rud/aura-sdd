# Research Methodology Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the standard methodologies used by the AURA Research skill across different research domains. Each methodology follows evidence-based practices with reproducible processes.

## General Research Principles

### 1. Evidence-Based Approach
- All claims must be supported by verifiable evidence
- Use multiple sources to validate findings
- Document source materials and citation methods
- Distinguish between facts, analysis, and recommendations

### 2. Reproducible Process
- Document each step of the research process
- Use standardized templates for data collection
- Maintain clear audit trails for all findings
- Enable others to replicate the research methodology

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Validate data sources for reliability and relevance
- Check for biases in data collection and analysis
- Use appropriate statistical methods for quantitative analysis
- Peer review findings when possible
