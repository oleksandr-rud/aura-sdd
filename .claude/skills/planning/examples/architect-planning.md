## Architecture Design

### System Overview
**Architecture Pattern**: Microservices with API Gateway
**Deployment**: Container-based (Docker + Kubernetes)
**Data Strategy**: Polyglot persistence with appropriate databases per service

### Core Microservices

#### 1. User Service
- **Responsibility**: User authentication, profiles, preferences
- **Technology**: Node.js + Express + MongoDB
- **Database**: MongoDB (document store)
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with load balancer
- **Security**: JWT tokens, bcrypt password hashing

#### 2. Product Service
- **Responsibility**: Product catalog, search, inventory management
- **Technology**: Java Spring Boot + Elasticsearch
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Elasticsearch
- **Scalability**: Read replicas for search functionality
- **Performance**: Redis caching for hot products

#### 3. Order Service
- **Responsibility**: Order processing, workflow management
- **Technology**: Python Django + Celery
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (ACID compliance)
- **Reliability**: Message queue for async processing
- **Transactions**: Saga pattern for distributed transactions

#### 4. Payment Service
- **Responsibility**: Payment processing, wallet management
- **Technology**: Go + gRPC
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Security**: PCI DSS compliance, encryption at rest
- **Integration**: Multiple payment gateway providers

#### 5. Notification Service
- **Responsibility**: Email, SMS, push notifications
- **Technology**: Node.js + Redis Pub/Sub
- **Database**: Redis (queue store)
- **Reliability**: Dead letter queues, retry mechanisms
- **Scalability**: Worker pool scaling based on queue length

### Infrastructure Architecture

#### API Gateway Layer
- **Technology**: Kong API Gateway
- **Features**: Rate limiting, authentication, load balancing
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling based on traffic
- **Monitoring**: Request/response metrics, error tracking

#### Service Mesh
- **Technology**: Istio Service Mesh
- **Features**: Service discovery, traffic management, security
- **Observability**: Distributed tracing, metrics collection
- **Security**: mTLS between services

#### Data Layer
- **Databases**:
  - PostgreSQL: Transactional data
  - MongoDB: User profiles, product catalogs
  - Redis: Caching, session management
  - Elasticsearch: Search functionality
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Disaster Recovery**: Multi-region replication with automatic failover

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Backend Technologies
| Service | Language | Framework | Rationale |
|---------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| User Service | Node.js | Express | Fast development, JSON handling, JWT support |
| Product Service | Java | Spring Boot | Enterprise features, search integration |
| Order Service | Python | Django | Business logic complexity, async processing |
| Payment Service | Go | Standard library | Performance, security, low memory footprint |
| Notification Service | Node.js | Express | Real-time capabilities, event-driven |

### Infrastructure Technologies
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent deployment
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for scaling and management
- **API Gateway**: Kong for edge routing and security
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for service communication
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana + Jaeger
- **CI/CD**: GitLab CI with automated testing and deployment

### Database Technologies
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary transactional database
- **MongoDB**: Flexible document storage
- **Redis**: High-performance caching
- **Elasticsearch**: Search and analytics
