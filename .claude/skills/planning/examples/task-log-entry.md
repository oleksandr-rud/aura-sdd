## Evidence Artifacts

The planning skill generates the following evidence artifacts:

### Primary Architecture Document
**File**: `plans/architecture-design-cms-2025-10-27.md`
- **Content**: 25-page comprehensive architecture specification
- **Sections**: Executive Summary, System Overview, Service Design, Technology Stack, NFRs, Security Architecture, Deployment Strategy, Risk Assessment
- **Diagrams**: System architecture diagrams, service interaction diagrams, deployment diagrams

### Supporting Design Documents
- `docs/service-specifications/` - Individual service specifications
- `docs/api-contracts/` - API contracts and data models
- `docs/deployment-strategy.md` - Detailed deployment approach
- `docs/monitoring-strategy.md` - Observability and monitoring plan

### Validation Artifacts
- `docs/nfr-validation.md` - NFR target validation methodology
- `docs/technology-rationale.md` - Technology selection rationale and trade-offs
- `docs/security-assessment.md` - Security architecture assessment
- `docs/risk-register.md` - Comprehensive risk register with mitigation plans

## Progressive Disclosure Benefits

This example demonstrates how the Claude Code Skills format enhances planning:

### Level 1: Skill Discovery
- **Metadata**: Skill name and description loaded at startup
- **Planning Types**: 4 planning templates discovered (agile, architect, testing, implementation)
- **Agent Mapping**: Default agent roles for each planning type

### Level 2: Planning Instructions
- **Architecture Procedures**: Specific architect planning methodology loaded
- **Quality Gates**: Architecture validation criteria and standards
- **Template Logic**: Architect template selected based on agent role and context

### Level 3: Planning Resources
- **Architecture Examples**: Detailed examples loaded for reference
- **Technology Templates**: Stack selection templates and patterns
- **Validation Scripts**: Architecture validation tools and checklists

## Workflow Integration

### AURA State Machine Integration
The planning execution follows the prescribed AURA workflow:

1. **FROM_STATE: DRAFT** - Initial requirements gathering phase
2. **TO_STATE: PLANNED** - Architecture completed and validated
3. **Next State**: Implementation planning with tech-lead

### Agent Coordination
- **Current Agent**: architect (architecture planning)
- **Next Agent**: tech-lead (implementation planning)
- **Supporting Agents**: product-ops (requirements validation), qa (quality planning)

### Quality Gates
The planning satisfies AURA quality gates:
- ‚úÖ **Architecture Review**: System design addresses all requirements
- ‚úÖ **Technology Validation**: Choices justified with trade-off analysis
- ‚úÖ **NFR Definition**: Measurable targets with validation criteria
- ‚úÖ **Risk Assessment**: Comprehensive risk identification and mitigation

## Resource Optimization

### Context Window Management
- **Relevant Content**: Only architect planning template loaded (not all 4 templates)
- **On-Demand Loading**: Architecture examples and patterns loaded as referenced
- **Efficient Storage**: Large architecture diagrams stored as references, not in context

### Tool Utilization
- **FileSystem**: Access to requirements, constraints, and existing documentation
- **Read**: Analysis of system requirements and technical constraints
- **Write**: Creation of architecture documents and specifications
- **WebSearch**: Research of technology options and best practices

## Next Steps in AURA Workflow

Based on the architect planning completion:

### 1. Stakeholder Review (Immediate)
```bash
# Architecture review with technical and business stakeholders
# Validate architecture approach and technology choices
# Identify any concerns or required adjustments
```

### 2. Implementation Planning (Next Gate)
```bash
exec story=AURA-003 skill=planning planning_type=implementation actor=tech-lead
```
**Purpose**: Create detailed implementation plan based on approved architecture

### 3. Agile Planning (Following Gate)
```bash
exec story=AURA-003 skill=planning planning_type=agile actor=product-ops
```
**Purpose**: Sequence development backlog and allocate team resources

## Success Metrics

### Planning Quality Metrics
- **Requirements Coverage**: 100% of functional requirements addressed
- **Architecture Compliance**: 100% adherence to defined patterns
- **Documentation Completeness**: All architecture components documented
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Architecture approved by all stakeholders

### NFR Validation Metrics
- **Performance Targets**: All performance NFRs defined and measurable
- **Security Requirements**: Comprehensive security architecture designed
- **Scalability Approach**: Clear path to support growth targets
- **Reliability Measures**: High availability and disaster recovery planned

## Integration Benefits Summary

This planning skill example demonstrates the powerful combination of:

1. **AURA Workflow**: Structured, agent-coordinated planning process
2. **Claude Skills Architecture**: Progressive disclosure and context optimization
3. **Comprehensive Planning**: Detailed methodology with quality gates
4. **Resource Management**: Efficient tool usage and context optimization
5. **Stakeholder Coordination**: Clear communication and handoff processes

The result is a planning capability that maintains the sophistication of the AURA system while gaining the efficiency and modularity of Claude Code Skills.
