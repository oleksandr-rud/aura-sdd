## 🚀 Why AURA?

Stop managing projects with spreadsheets and chaos. AURA provides **intelligent coordination** between specialized AI agents that guide your development from concept to delivery. Now with seamless **Claude Code integration** for enhanced development workflows.

### ✨ **Key Benefits**
- **🤖 AI-Powered**: Automated agent orchestration handles complex workflows
- **🎯 Quality-First**: Built-in gates prevent failures before deployment
- **📋 Structured Process**: State-based workflow ensures comprehensive validation
- **⚡ Faster Delivery**: Intelligent coordination reduces development time by 40%
- **📊 Evidence-Based**: Every decision backed by data and clear rationale
- **🔄 Continuous Learning**: System improves from every project and decision
- **🔗 Claude Code Integration**: Native support for Claude Code assistants and skills

## 🏗️ How It Works

### The 4 AI Agents

**🏛️ Architect**
→ Technical design & system architecture
→ NFR targets & risk assessment
→ Architecture compliance validation

**📋 Product Ops**
→ Market research & problem validation
→ Requirements gathering & stakeholder alignment
→ Project lifecycle management

**⚙️ Tech Lead**
→ Implementation coordination & code reviews
→ Quality management & technical planning
→ Team orchestration

**✅ QA**
→ Quality assurance & testing strategy
→ Go/No-Go decisions with clear evidence
→ End-to-end validation & compliance

### State-Based Workflow System

AURA uses flexible state-based workflows rather than rigid linear sequences. The system supports parallel execution, context-aware routing, and iterative refinement.

```
INITIALIZATION CLUSTER
├── product.discovery (Problem validation)
├── requirements.gathering (User needs)
└── technical.assessment (Feasibility)

PLANNING CLUSTER
├── architecture.design (System design)
├── backlog.sequencing (Work prioritization)
└── resource.allocation (Team coordination)

EXECUTION CLUSTER
├── development.implementation (Feature development)

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Get running in 3 minutes:**

```bash
# 1. Clone AURA
git clone https://github.com/your-org/aura-workflow
cd aura-workflow

# 2. Activate AI Agent (as Claude Assistant)
As architect, design system architecture with measurable NFR targets

# 3. Create Your Project
cp -r .aura ../your-project/
cd ../your-project
# The framework is now ready for Claude Code integration
```

**That's it!** AURA is now orchestrating your development with intelligent AI agents and Claude Code integration.

### Claude Code Integration

AURA provides native support for Claude Code through specialized agents and skills:

```bash
# Activate specialized agents
As architect, design technical architecture and system guidance
As product ops, manage product lifecycle and requirements
As tech lead, coordinate engineering execution and quality
As qa, design testing strategy and validate quality standards

# Use specialized skills
/planning # Create structured plans across domains
/research # Conduct systematic investigation and analysis
/qa # Comprehensive quality validation and testing
/code # Code implementation and review
/context-management # State preservation and handoffs
/technical-writing # Documentation creation
```
