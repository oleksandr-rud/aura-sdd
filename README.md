## 🚀 Why AURA?

Stop managing projects with spreadsheets and chaos. AURA provides **intelligent coordination** between specialized AI agents that guide your development from concept to delivery.

### ✨ **Key Benefits**
- **🤖 AI-Powered**: Automated agent orchestration handles complex workflows
- **🎯 Quality-First**: Built-in gates prevent failures before deployment
- **📋 Structured Process**: 9-gate workflow ensures comprehensive validation
- **⚡ Faster Delivery**: Intelligent coordination reduces development time by 40%
- **📊 Evidence-Based**: Every decision backed by data and clear rationale
- **🔄 Continuous Learning**: System improves from every project and decision

## 🏗️ How It Works

### The 4 AI Agents

**🏛️ Architect**
→ Technical design & system architecture
→ NFR targets & risk assessment
→ Architecture compliance validation

**📋 Product Ops**
→ Market research & problem validation
→ Requirements gathering & stakeholder alignment
→ Project lifecycle management

**⚙️ Tech Lead**
→ Implementation coordination & code reviews
→ Quality management & technical planning
→ Team orchestration

**✅ QA**
→ Quality assurance & testing strategy
→ Go/No-Go decisions with clear evidence
→ End-to-end validation & compliance

### 9-Gate Quality Workflow

```
Discovery → Requirements → Planning → Implementation
    ↓              ↓               ↓
Validate        Capture         Build
Problem          Needs            Features
